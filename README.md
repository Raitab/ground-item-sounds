# Ground Item Sounds
Plays various sound effects when specific ground item tiers appear.

Tiers are determined by the highlighted and value settings found in the `Ground Items` plugin *(does not need to be enabled for this plugin to work).*
## Customization
To use your own sounds for each tier, replace the corresponding .wav file found in:

`User/.runelite/ground-item-sounds`

with a **.wav file** of the **same name**.
